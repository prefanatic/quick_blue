## Platform Notes

### Android
- Ensure you have the correct permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (see [quick_blue/android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml](quick_blue/android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)).
- Some device-specific quirks may apply (see [issues](https://github.com/pisontechnology/quick_blue/issues)).

### iOS/macOS
- Some common service/characteristic UUIDs may be shortened. UUIDs are matched case-insensitively and 16-bit UUIDs are expanded against the Bluetooth base UUID, so either short or full 128-bit form works.
- `requestMtu` cannot request a specific value — CoreBluetooth negotiates the ATT MTU automatically at connection. The call returns the negotiated MTU currently in effect (`maximumWriteValueLength(for: .withoutResponse) + 3`); the `expectedMtu` argument is advisory.
- Advertised manufacturer data is surfaced via `BlueScanResult.manufacturerDataHead` (and `manufacturerData`, which falls back to the head when no full payload is available).
- Companion device association (`companionAssociate`/`getCompanionAssociations`) is Android-only and throws `UnsupportedError` here.
- See [Apple Bluetooth documentation](https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/).

### Windows
- See [Microsoft Bluetooth samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/microsoft/windows-universal-samples/bluetoothle).
- There may be version restrictions for connection without pairing.

### Linux
- Uses BlueZ. See [BlueZ documentation](http://www.bluez.org/).
